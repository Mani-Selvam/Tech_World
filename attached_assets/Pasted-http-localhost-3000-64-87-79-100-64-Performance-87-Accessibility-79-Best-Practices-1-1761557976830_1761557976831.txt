Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Names and labels
Buttons do not have an accessible name
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
Best practices
[user-scalable="no"] is used in the <meta name="viewport"> element or the [maximum-scale] attribute is less than 5.
These items highlight common accessibility best practices.
Navigation
Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order
These are opportunities to improve keyboard navigation in your application.
Additional items to manually check (10)

These items address areas which an automated testing tool cannot cover. Learn more in our guide on conducting an accessibility review.
